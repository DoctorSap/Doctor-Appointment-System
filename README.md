# Doctor-Appointment-System
The proposed project is a smart appointment booking system that provides patients or any user an easy way of booking a doctor’s appointment online. This is a web based application that overcomes the issue of managing and booking appointments according to user’s choice or demands. The task sometimes becomes very tedious for the compounder or doctor himself in manually allotting appointments for the users as per their availability. Hence this project offers an effective solution where users can view various booking slots available and select the preferred date and time. The already booked space will be marked yellow and will not be available for anyone else for the specified time. This system also allows users to cancel their booking anytime. The system provides an additional feature of calculating monthly earnings of doctor. Doctor has to just feed the system regularly with daily earnings and the system automatically generates a report of total amount earned at the end of the month. The application uses html,css,bootstrap,javascript,jquery as a front-end and mysql database and php  as the back-end.
